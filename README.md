This repository contains data and R code used in my MSc project entitled “Can psychological inoculation improve the effectiveness of a male-sensitive brochure for psychological help-seeking?”. This study investigates the effectiveness of two behaviour change interventions designed to improve attitudes towards, and self-stigma around, psychological help-seeking.

This repository contains the R script used to run the data cleaning and analysis (“Cleaning_and_analysis.R”) along with the original data sets (“Data”). The “Codebook.txt” file contains some more information on the variable names and their values. If you would like to learn more about permissions to reuse any of this material please see the “LICENCE” file.
